## remarkRelativeUrlsAdjustment() function

The Remark plugin streamlines URL adjustments in Markdown files, ensuring links remain accurate even after file relocations or inclusions.

Images and links within the markdown file will have their paths adjusted to be relative to the new document location.

When `processor.data().filePathChanges` is set, this plugin adjusts all relative URLs for images, definitions, and links to ensure they are accurate.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function remarkRelativeUrlsAdjustment(this: Processor): Transformer;
```
